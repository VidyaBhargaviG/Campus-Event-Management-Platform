### Database Schema
```
Colleges (1) ←→ (N) Students
Colleges (1) ←→ (N) Events
Students (N) ←→ (N) Events (Registrations)
Students (N) ←→ (N) Events (Attendance)
Students (N) ←→ (N) Events (Feedback)
```

## 📊 Sample Data Implementation

### Colleges (5)

- **Student Analytics**: Participation tracking and rankings
- **College Comparisons**: Cross-institution performance
- **Popularity Rankings**: Most engaging events

### 4. **Edge Case Management**
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Database constraints + API validation
- **Capacity Handling**: Waitlist management with auto-promotion
- **Cancellation Support**: Graceful event cancellation
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and error handling

## 📈 Reporting Examples

### Event Popularity Report
```json
